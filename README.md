# Naive Greedy Mesh Algorithm
Naive implementation of the greedy mesh algorithm for a voxel environment.

[The blog post](https://0fps.net/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game/), I took the idea from, propagated first the `x-axis` and then the other two axes. This algorithm is only applied in two dimensions for demenstration purposes. Its extendable to the third dimension, by calculating the `zCounter` analogously to the first two axes.
